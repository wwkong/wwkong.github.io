description: "A Julia package for non-smooth optimization algorithms. This package provides algorithms for the minimization of objective functions that include non-smooth terms, such as constraints or non-differentiable penalties. Implemented algorithms include: 


- (Fast) Proximal gradient methods  

- Douglas-Rachford splitting  

- Three-term splitting  

- Primal-dual splitting algorithms  

- Newton-type methods  


This package works well in combination with ProximalOperators, which contains a wide range of functions that can be used to express cost terms."
