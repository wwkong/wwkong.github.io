description: "An open source software package for **N**onconvex **C**omposite **Opt**imization in MATLAB. Its main purpose is to: (a) provide a general API for creating models based on a first-order oracle framework; and (b) leverage the fast matrix subroutines in MATLAB to solve these models. The interface of NC-OPT is loosely based on the well-known Gurobi API."
