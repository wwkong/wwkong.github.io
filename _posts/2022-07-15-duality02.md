We now look at some conditions that imply at least one of ${\cal P}$ or ${\cal P^{*}}$ has solutions, as well as some nice properties that are a consequence of this fact. Later, we look at the relationship between our previous developments, the classic Lagrangian of ${\cal P}$, and the well-known saddle-point duality.

## Existence of Solutions 

Throughout our discussion, we will suppose that $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$.

For brevity, we say that ${\cal P}$ is stable if $h(0)$ and $h$ is subdifferentiable at $0$. The next result relates normality, stability, and the existence of solutions.

**Proposition III.1.** *The following conditions are equivalent:*

1.  *${\cal P}$ and ${\cal P}^{\*}$ are normal and have some solutions.*

2.  *${\cal P}$ and ${\cal P^{\*}}$ are stable.*

3.  *${\cal P}$ is stable and has some solutions.*

A sufficient condition for stability is as follows.

**Proposition III.2.** *Suppose (i) $\Phi$ is convex, (ii) $\inf\ {\cal P}$ is finite, and (iii) there exists $u_{0}\in V$ such that $\Phi(u_{0},\cdot)$ is finite and continuous at $0$. Then, ${\cal P}$ is stable.*

**Remark III.3.** Condition (iii) in the above result immediately implies the existence of solutions of ${\cal P}^{\*}$ and acts as a sort of *constraint qualification* for ${\cal P}$.

## Extremal Relationships 

The following result gives a nice property in the case where ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal P^{\*}}$ both have solutions.

**Proposition III.4.** *Suppose ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal P^{\*}}$ have solutions, $\inf\ {\cal P}=\sup\ {\cal P}^{\*}$, and this number is finite. Then all solutions $\bar{u}$ of ${\cal P}$ and all solutions $\bar{p}^{\*}$ of ${\cal P}^{\*}$ satisfy the extremality relation*

$$\Phi(\bar{u},0)+\Phi^{*}(0,\bar{p}^{*})=0,$$ 

*or equivalently,*

$$(0,\bar{p}^{*})\in\partial\Phi(\bar{u},0).$$ 

*Conversely, if $\bar{u}\in V$ and $\bar{p}^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$ satisfy the above extremality relation, then $\bar{u}$ is a solution of ${\cal P}$, $\bar{p}^{\*}$ is a solution of ${\cal P}^{\*}$, $\inf\ {\cal P}=\sup\ {\cal P}^{\*}$, and this number is finite.*

**Remark III.5.** The definition of the conjugate function implies that 

$$\Phi(u,0)+\Phi^{*}(0,p^{*})\geq\left\langle (u,0),(0,p^{*})\right\rangle =0$$ 

for every $u\in V$ and $p^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$. It is for this reason that $\Phi(\bar{u},0)+\Phi^{\*}(0,\bar{p}^{\*})=0$ is called an extremality relation.

## Lagrangian of ${\cal P}$ 

The Lagrangian $L:V\times Y^{\*}\mapsto\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ of ${\cal P}$ relative to $\Phi$ is given by 

$$-L(u,p^{*}):=\sup_{p\in Y}\left\{ \left\langle p^{*},p\right\rangle -\Phi(u,p)\right\}$$ 

for every $u\in V$ and $p^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$.

**Remark IV.1.** For a fixed $u\in V$, let $\Phi_{u}$ be the function $p\mapsto\Phi(u,p)$. It is straightforward to see that $-L(u,p^{\*})=\Phi_{u}^{\*}(p^{\*})$.

The result gives some basic properties of $L$.

**Proposition IV.2.** *For every $u\in V$, the function $p^{\*}\mapsto L(u,p^{\*})$ is an upper semicontinuous function of $Y^{\*}$ into $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$. On the other hand, if $\Phi$ is convex then for every $p^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$ the function $u\mapsto L(u,p^{\*})$ is convex from $V$ into $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.*

**Remark IV.3.** Unfortunately, we cannot assert that $u\mapsto L(u,p^{*})$ is lower semicontinuous even if $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$.

**Remark IV.4.** Without any assumptions on $\Phi$, it can be shown that the following relationships hold: 

$$\begin{aligned}
-\Phi^{*}(0,p^{*}) & =\inf_{u\in V}L(u,p^{*}),\\
{\cal P}^{*} & \equiv\sup_{p^{*}\in Y^{*}}\inf_{u\in V}L(u,p^{*}).\end{aligned}$$ 

**Remark IV.5.** If $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$, it can be shown that the following relationships hold: 

$$\begin{aligned}
\Phi(u,0) & =\sup_{p^{*}\in Y^{*}}L(u,p^{*}),\\
{\cal P} & \equiv\inf_{u\in V}\sup_{p^{*}\in Y^{*}}L(u,p^{*}).\end{aligned}$$

## Saddle-Point Duality 

We can see from the previous results that there is a possible min-max saddle-point duality if $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$. In this subsection, we give the precise relationships.

For brevity, let us say that $(\bar{u},p^{\*})\in V\times Y^{\*}$ is a *saddle point* of $L$ if 

$$L(\bar{u},p^{*})\leq L(\bar{u},\bar{p}^{*})\leq L(u,\bar{p}^{*})$$ 

for every $u\in V$ and $p^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$.

**Proposition IV.6.** *If $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$ then the following statements are equivalent:*

1.  *$(\bar{u},\bar{p}^{\*})$ is a saddle point of $L$.*

2.  *$\bar{u}$ is a solution of ${\cal P}$, $\bar{p}^{\*}$ is a solution of ${\cal P^{\*}}$, and $\inf\ {\cal P}=\sup\ {\cal P}^{\*}$.*

**Proposition IV.7.** *Suppose $\Phi\in\Gamma_{0}(V\times Y)$ and ${\cal P}$ is stable. Then $\bar{u}\in V$ is a solution of ${\cal P}$ if and only if there exists $\bar{p}^{\*}\in Y^{\*}$ such that $(\bar{u},\bar{p}^{\*})$ is a saddle point of $L$.*
