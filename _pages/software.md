1. [**NC-OPT**](https://nc-opt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  
An open source software package for **N**onconvex **C**omposite **Opt**imization in MATLAB. Its main purpose is to: (a) provide a general API for creating models based on a first-order oracle framework; and (b) leverage the fast matrix subroutines in MATLAB to solve these models. The interface of NC-OPT is loosely based on the well-known Gurobi API.

1. [**TASMANIAN**](https://tasmanian.ornl.gov/index.html)  
The **T**oolkit for **A**daptive **S**tochastic **M**odeling and **N**on-**I**ntrusive **A**pproximatio**N** is a collection of robust libraries for high dimensional integration and interpolation as well as parameter calibration. The code consists of several modules that can be used individually or conjointly. The project is sponsored by Oak Ridge National Laboratory Directed Research and Development as well as the Department of Energy Office for Advanced Scientific Computing Research.
