Hi there! My name is William Kong and here you will find some of my recent [publications](/publications), involvements in open-source [software](/software), and detailed [course notes](/notes).

Currently, I am employed at [Google Research (NYC)](https://research.google/locations/new-york/) as a Research Software Engineer in [Athena](https://research.google/teams/athena/). 

Prior to my current role, I was a postdoc in the [Computer Science and Mathematics Division](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csmd) at [Oak Ridge National Labs](https://www.ornl.gov/) under [Miroslav Stoyanov](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/miroslav-k-stoyanov). Before that, I worked as a Research Intern for two summers at [Google Research (MTV)](https://research.google/teams/) and as a Senior Risk Analyst for 2.5 years at [TD Bank](https://www.td.com/us/en/personal-banking). 

I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) under [Renato D.C. Monteiro](https://sites.gatech.edu/renato-monteiro/), specializing in accelerated iterative methods for nonconvex continuous optimization. My other degrees include a M.Sc. in Computational Science & Engineering from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a B.Math. from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).
