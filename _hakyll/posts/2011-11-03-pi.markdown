One of the few of mathematics related details that really bugged me during high school
, was the irrationality of $\pi$.

There was no easy proof that I could use, at the time, that could prove it was irrational unlike simpler numbers such as $\sqrt{2}$. I could not even find any teacher at the time who could explain to me using basic calculus why the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its radius was never rational.

Skip many years ahead, and I came upon this interesting, albeit "short" [proof](http://www.lrz.de/~hr/numb/pi-irr.html). Although the proof can be summarized through eight remarks and a few properties about integrals, trying to prove each remark can be a bit challenging. I would estimate that the average high school grade 11 or 12 student would not be able to get past the second remark without great difficulty.

That is why I compiled [this](/files/Irrationality_of_Pi.pdf), a fairly easy to follow guide detailing each of the remarks and their derivations. In the .pdf, I also left a couple exercises for the reader to do just for fun, but if you really need to know the answer, don\'t hesitate to email me.
